# node-task-app-project
A MongoDB-backed Node task manager project app.

I wrote this app as part of the Udemy "Complete Node.js" online course. I have deployed the Node web app and API to Heroku and the MongoDB back end to MongoDB Atlas.

To run locally: `npm run dev` and `mongodb` to start the DB instance.
